Python Discord is a programming community with over 300,000 members from around the globe.

As an owner of Python Discord I'm responsible for maintaining the community and managing external collaborations with organisations such as the PSF as well as sponsorships with companies such as Linode, Sentry, Netlify and more.

I also hold the role of DevOps Lead within Python Discord in which I maintain the Kubernetes cluster which the Python Discord infrastructure resides on. We use technologies such as Calico, CoreDNS, Prometheus, PostgreSQL and more to host over 50 applications for the Python Discord community ranging from our community site at <a href="https://pythondiscord.com">pythondiscord.com</a> to our moderation bot.

See below for a talk I did in July 2021 about the infrastructure at Python Discord:
